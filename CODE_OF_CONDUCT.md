# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include welcoming language, respectful feedback, and focus on what is best for the community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include harassment, trolling, publishing others' private information, or other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and taking corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior.

## Scope
This Code applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual represents the project or its community.

## Enforcement
Report incidents to the maintainers via GitHub Issues (for non-sensitive matters) or designated private contact (to be added). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly.

## Attribution
Adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1 (https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).
