> ConsciousDB is the physics-based, model‑free reranking sidecar for RAG: a 50ms P95 coherence solve that shows **why** results rank via auditable ΔH energy receipts — no training, no drift, just math on your existing vectors.

### Core Highlights
🚀 Explainable reranking (per-item energy decomposition, neighbors, solver stats)<br/>
📊 Energy receipts (ΔH trace identity + component attribution)<br/>
🧠 Model-free (your vector DB *is* the model; convex optimization, not another black box)<br/>
⚡ Low latency (CPU-friendly SPD solve; typical ~50ms P95 in mock/local tests)<br/>
🔒 Non-invasive (BYO vector store: Pinecone, pgvector, Chroma, Vertex AI, Memory)<br/>
🛡️ Audit & ops ready (structured diagnostics, Prometheus metrics, receipt versioning)

## Why it exists
Raw vector DBs return nearest neighbors but cannot tell you **why** results rank or how structure could adapt. Rerankers shuffle scores heuristically; global graph builds are heavy and intrusive. ConsciousDB induces a **local subgraph per query**, optimizes a convex coherence objective, and returns results with an **explainability receipt** (ΔH + per-item decomposition). You keep your embeddings where they already live (Pinecone, pgvector, Vertex AI, Chroma) — we pull only ephemeral candidate vectors.

---

## The Database-as-Model Paradigm

Traditional rerankers add another model layer on top of your vectors. **ConsciousDB takes a different path: your vector database *is* the model.** We do not introduce another neural network— we apply transparent convex optimization directly over the structure already latent in your embeddings.

### How it works
- **No training phase** — We operate directly on your existing embeddings (no finetuning, no labeled sets).
- **Query-time intelligence** — Each query induces a fresh, local k-NN subgraph from the retrieved candidates.
- **Physics-based reasoning** — We solve a positive-definite energy minimization (think molecular dynamics / springs) where similar vectors attract and incoherent structure is smoothed.
- **Structure from data** — The graph is emergent from your vectors (mutual cosine kNN); there are no learned parameters to drift.

### What this means for you
✅ No model versioning or silent drift

✅ Zero training data requirements

✅ No GPU model-serving fleet (CPU-friendly solve)

✅ Mathematical transparency (SPD linear system + per-term energy decomposition)

✅ Your data never leaves your infrastructure boundary

This “database as model” stance lets you gain model-like reranking uplift with the operational footprint of a thin sidecar.

---

## Core Value Pillars
- **Auditable** – Every answer ships with a receipt: `deltaH_total`, per-item `coherence_drop`, `anchor_drop`, `ground_penalty`, local neighbors & edge weights, CG iteration stats, gate/fallback reasons.
- **Explainable & Model‑Free** – No neural reranker or learned parameters: your vectors are the model. We blend z‑scored coherence improvement with smoothed alignment after a convex (SPD) solve—fully inspectable math, not another black box.
- **Adaptive (opt‑in)** – A sparse edge state (tenant-scoped) can learn edge strengths & hyper-parameters from feedback using lightweight bandit / Hebbian updates (no raw data copy).
- **Non‑invasive** – BYOVDB. No corpus migration, no re-indexing. Private connectivity / VPC compatible.

### ConsciousDB vs Traditional Rerankers
| Aspect | Traditional Reranker | ConsciousDB |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| Model | Separate neural network | Your vectors ARE the model |
| Training | Supervised / finetuning required | None – pure convex optimization |
| Interpretability | Opaque learned weights | Per-item energy decomposition (coherence / anchor / ground) |
| Data movement | Vectors → model → scores | Vectors → local graph → energy solve |
| Deployment | Model serving infra + scaling | Lightweight sidecar (stateless compute + optional tiny state) |
| Drift Surface | Silent weight drift over time | No learned weights; graph derived fresh each query |
| Hardware | Often GPU inference | CPU-friendly iterative solver |
| Auditing | Post-hoc approximations | First-class receipt (ΔH + terms + neighbors) |

## High-Level Flow
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Q[Query] --> E[Embed]
  E --> R[Vector DB Recall (M)]
  R --> G[Local kNN Graph]
  G --> S[SPD Solve (CG)]
  S --> A[Per-Node ΔH Attribution]
  A --> RK[Rank & Diversify]
  RK --> RC[Receipt JSON]
```
1. Recall: Fetch top-M candidates from your existing vector DB.
2. Graph Build: Mutual cosine k-NN (optionally expand for hard queries).
3. Solve: Jacobi-preconditioned CG over normalized Laplacian + anchor/ground terms.
4. Attribution: Per-node coherence, anchor, ground components giving ΔH conservation.
5. Rank: Blend coherence uplift (z-scored) + smoothed alignment (optional MMR if redundancy high).
6. Receipt: Items + per-item terms, neighbors, ΔH totals, solver diagnostics, gates/fallbacks.

## Key Concepts
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ΔH / deltaH_total | Total coherence (energy) improvement from optimization vs baseline. |
| coherence_drop_i | Node-level contribution to ΔH used in ranking. |
| Smoothed alignment | Cosine similarity using solved embedding Q*_i (structure-aware). |
| Redundancy | Mean pairwise cosine among provisional top-K (diversification signal). |
| Fallback Reason | Enumerated trigger (`forced`, `iters_cap`, `residual`). |

## Roadmap (Pivot Phases)
1. Receipt Fundamentals – expose `deltaH_total`, populate neighbors with weights, alias old `coh_drop_total`.
2. Observability & Audit – audit log stream, deltaH histogram, gate counters, receipt completeness metrics.
3. Adaptive Scaffold – opt‑in edge-state store + feedback-driven updates (no raw data retention). (In progress: suggested_alpha v0, query_id linkage, feedback correlation.)
4. Bandit Hyperparameters – per-tenant tuning of α, expansion threshold, k_adj.
5. Connector Hardening & Security – real pgvector impl, retries, rate limiting, audit retention, VPC guidelines.
6. Benchmark & Uplift – harness, uplift vs vector-only, CI guard on edge overlap & uplift thresholds.
7. Docs & Dashboard – RECEIPTS.md, live receipt viewer / Postman collection; pricing switches.

## Metrics (Current + Planned)
(Condensed – full definitions & interpretation live in `docs/OPERATIONS.md`.)
Current:
- query_latency_ms, graph_build_ms, solve_ms, rank_ms
- query_total{fallback,easy_gate,coh_gate}
- cg_iterations_bucket
- redundancy histogram
- mmr_applied_total
- max_residual gauge
- deltaH_total histogram
- gate_easy_total, gate_low_impact_total, gate_fallback_total
- receipt_completeness_ratio gauge
- adaptive_feedback_total{positive}
- adaptive_suggested_alpha gauge
- adaptive_events_buffer_size gauge

Planned:
- adaptive_updates_total{outcome}
- bandit_arm_selected_total{arm}
- fallback_reason labeled counter (may reuse existing with label expansion)
 - learned_edge_strength histogram
 - adaptive_applied_alpha_total (count times system auto-applies suggestion)

---

## Adaptive Loop (Persistence, Auto-Apply & Bandit)
(See `docs/ADAPTIVE.md` for full algorithm, state schema, and precedence.)
When `ENABLE_ADAPTIVE=true` each `/query` receives a `query_id` caching its `(deltaH_total, redundancy)`. `/feedback` referencing that ID updates an in-memory ring buffer (≤200) and recomputes a correlation between coherence uplift and positive feedback (accept OR any click) every 5 events after a 15‑event warmup, yielding a `suggested_alpha` in [0.02, 0.5].

### Persistence
State (events, suggested_alpha, bandit arm stats) is snapshotted atomically to `adaptive_state.json` (override with `ADAPTIVE_STATE_PATH`) on feedback and shutdown, and reloaded at startup for continuity.

### Automatic Application
Enable `ENABLE_ADAPTIVE_APPLY=true` to automatically substitute `suggested_alpha` for the manual `alpha_deltaH` override in the ranking blend. Diagnostics expose:
- `suggested_alpha`
- `applied_alpha`
- `alpha_source` = `manual` | `suggested` | `bandit`
Precedence: suggested > bandit > manual.

### Bandit Hyperparameter Exploration
Set `ENABLE_BANDIT=true` to activate a UCB1 multi-armed bandit over alpha arms `[0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3]`. The bandit ensures cold-start exploration (one pull per arm) then balances exploitation via classical UCB score. Reward = 1 if feedback included acceptance or any click, else 0. Arm stats persist with adaptive state. Average per-arm reward surfaces via metrics.

### Metrics Added
- `conscious_adaptive_feedback_total{positive}`
- `conscious_adaptive_suggested_alpha`
- `conscious_adaptive_events_buffer_size`
- `conscious_bandit_arm_select_total{alpha}`
- `conscious_bandit_arm_avg_reward{alpha}`
- `conscious_fallback_reason_total{reason}` (granular fallback attribution)

### Audit Log Signing
If `AUDIT_HMAC_KEY` is set, each JSONL audit entry gains `signature` (hex SHA-256 HMAC over sorted JSON sans signature) enabling integrity verification. Absent the key, logging remains unchanged.

---

## Pricing & Justification (Summary)
ConsciousDB pricing is a transparent value-capture model (see `docs/PRICING_MODEL.md`). We target ~35% (band 25–45%) of empirically measured customer savings across three channels:

- Token Savings – fewer follow-up LLM calls and pruned context.
- Time Savings – reduced human escalation / analyst minutes.
- Reranker Substitution – avoided spend vs. external rerank APIs (if previously used).

Public plan anchors (illustrative): Free (10K), Developer ($79 / 50K), Pro ($499 / 500K), Team ($999 / 1M), Scale ($1,499 / 2M), Enterprise (volume $0.0008–$0.0012/query). Marginal overage prices remain ROI-positive and scale down per‑1K as volume grows. A data dictionary and full sensitivity sweep live in `PRICING_RESEARCH_AND_SIMULATIONS.md` (CSV-backed).

Governance: quarterly capture band review (or sooner if LLM token pricing shifts >20%). If realized value capture drifts above 45%, we offer credits / reserved discounts; if below 25%, we may adjust overage for sustainability.

Why this matters: customers can audit the economics, avoiding opaque, lock-in style per-vector or storage fees—pricing tracks delivered coherence & retrieval uplift, not mere data volume.

## Live Demo & Sandbox

You can spin up an interactive demo that surfaces the full **coherence receipt** without writing code.

### 1. Streamlit (local fastest)
```bash
pip install -e .[dev,demo,embedders-sentencetransformers]
$env:USE_MOCK = 'true'      # deterministic synthetic dataset
uvicorn api.main:app --port 8080 --reload  # in one terminal

# In a second terminal
streamlit run demo/streamlit_app.py
```
Set `CONSCIOUSDB_API` to point at a remote deployment if not local.

### 2. Cloud Run Sandbox
Deploy a public (rate-limited) mock-backed endpoint for investors / prospects:
```bash
./ops/cloudrun_deploy.sh consciousdb-sandbox us-central1
# After deploy, capture the HTTPS URL and export:
export CONSCIOUSDB_API="https://<cloud-run-url>"
streamlit run demo/streamlit_app.py
```
Recommended hardening before sharing externally:
- Set `API_KEYS` and distribute a single evaluation key.
- Configure Cloud Armor / request quotas if exposure expected.
- Periodically rotate the evaluation key; disable write paths if you later add ingestion.

### 3. Colab Notebook (shareable)
Create a new Colab and run:
```python
!pip install consciousdb-sidecar[embedders-sentencetransformers]
import requests, json
API="https://<cloud-run-url>"
resp = requests.post(f"{API}/query", json={"query":"vector governance controls","k":6,"m":400})
print(json.dumps(resp.json()["diagnostics"], indent=2))
```
Enhance with: bar chart of per-item coherence drops, redundancy vs ΔH scatter, iterative residual trace (if you expose it later).

### Receipt Exploration Ideas
- Compare `align` vs `baseline_align` uplift distribution.
- Visualize top-k neighbor graph (weights from `neighbors`).
- Monitor solver efficiency: `coh_drop_total / solve_ms`.

### Next After Demo
1. Benchmark report (ΔH vs vanilla retrieval quality on a known eval set).
2. Early design partner case study (before/after search quality & cost metrics).
3. Sales deck section embedding a GIF of the Streamlit demo (narrated receipt walkthrough).

## SLO Guardrails
- P95 end-to-end latency budget target: ≤ 400 ms for K ≤ 8.
- Iteration SLO: warn if max CG iterations > 12.
- Residual SLO: warn if residual > 2× tolerance.
- Fallback rate target: < 5% (excluding forced tests).

---

## Security / Enterprise Posture
- API key auth (header, constant-time compare) – present.
- Planned: per-tenant rate limiting, audit log stream (JSONL, redactable), private networking guidance, credential rotation hook, optional HMAC signing.
- No raw customer corpus persisted; optional adaptive state stores only hashed IDs & edge weights.

> Investor line: “ConsciousDB is the model-free coherence layer for AI retrieval. Instead of adding another neural network, it treats your vector database as the model itself—applying physics-based convex optimization (ΔH) to make search auditable, adaptive, and transparent. No training, no drift, no black box—just math on your existing vectors.”
