# Licensing Strategy

This project uses the Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1) with a timed conversion to Apache 2.0.

## Rationale
| Goal | Why BSL Helps |
|------|---------------|
| Protect early commercial differentiation | Prevents direct SaaS/product competitors from running the code in production immediately. |
| Encourage community experimentation | Evaluation, research, internal trials, benchmarks, academic use allowed. |
| Future open ecosystem | Automatic conversion to a permissive license fosters long-term adoption & trust. |
| Investor alignment | De-risks immediate commoditization while signaling an open trajectory. |

## Key Dates
- Change Date: **2028-10-05**
- On/after that date the code in this repository (as of that date) becomes **Apache-2.0**.

## Summary Matrix (Pre-Change Date)
| Use Case | Allowed Without Commercial License? | Notes |
|----------|--------------------------------------|-------|
| Local evaluation / POC | ✅ | Includes internal benchmarking. |
| Academic research / papers | ✅ | Please cite the project. |
| Internal non-revenue tool | ✅ | Not user/customer-facing. |
| Educational / workshops | ✅ | Must retain license text. |
| Production SaaS feature | ❌ | Requires commercial agreement. |
| Managed service offering | ❌ | Requires commercial agreement. |
| Embedding into paid distributed product | ❌ | Requires commercial agreement. |

## After Conversion
On the Change Date the license switches to Apache-2.0 for the then-existing codebase. Future commits may continue under BSL (with a new future date) or move fully to Apache at project discretion.

## Contributing Under BSL
By submitting a contribution you agree it is licensed under the then-current project license (BSL 1.1 with scheduled Apache conversion). If you cannot accept this, please do not submit contributions.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Is this Open Source?**
Not under the OSI definition until the Apache conversion; it is a Source-Available model with a predetermined permissive transition.

**Can I fork and run my own hosted service now?**
No; production / commercial hosting is restricted pre-change date.

**How will dual versions be handled?**
At change time, a tag will denote the commit set converting to Apache-2.0. Any later BSL cycles (if used) will document their own future date.

**Will the Change Date move?**
We intend it to be a firm upper bound; earlier conversion is possible but extension is not planned.
