# Documentation Gap Analysis (2025-10-05)

This file enumerates missing or outdated documentation areas relative to current code capabilities.

## High-Priority Gaps
| Gap | Description | Impact | Proposed Doc |
|-----|-------------|--------|--------------|
| Configuration Matrix | Central table of env vars, defaults, precedence, security notes | Onboarding friction; misconfiguration risk | CONFIGURATION.md |
| Operations Runbook | Metrics catalog w/ interpretation, log field dictionary, SLO guard instructions | Slower incident response | OPERATIONS.md |
| Adaptive & Bandit Deep Dive | Detailed algorithmic description, state schema, failure modes, reproducibility | Harder to audit adaptive behavior | ADAPTIVE.md |
| Troubleshooting Guide | Common errors (dimension mismatch, missing vectors, fallback spikes, residual issues) & resolutions | Support burden | TROUBLESHOOTING.md |
| Benchmark / Uplift Methodology | How to run internal harness, interpret nDCG deltas, edge overlap checks | Evidence for ROI | BENCHMARKS.md |
| Deployment Security Hardening | Concrete steps: API gateway, rate limiting, HMAC verification script, log shipping | Enterprise readiness | SECURITY.md (append) / OPERATIONS.md |
| Receipt Change Log | Versioned evolution of receipt fields & deprecations | Client integration stability | Append to RECEIPTS.md |
| Architecture Diagram | Visual (sequence + component) | Conceptual clarity | diagram asset (future) |

## Medium-Priority Gaps
| Gap | Description | Proposed |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| Connector Capability Matrix | Features & limitations per backend (vectors returned? auth mode?) | Expand CONNECTORS.md |
| Edge Learning Spec | Hebbian edge update pseudo-code & constraints | ADAPTIVE.md (future) |
| Audit Log Integrity Guide | Script + canonical serialization rules | OPERATIONS.md |
| Rate Limiting Design (planned) | Token bucket parameters & metrics | OPERATIONS.md (future) |
| Packaging / Versioning Policy | Semver + receipt version bump rules | CONTRIBUTING.md / RECEIPTS.md |

## Low-Priority Gaps
| Gap | Description | Proposed |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| Multi-tenant Isolation Patterns | Tenant-aware connectors, state partitioning | ARCHITECTURE.md (later) |
| Performance Tuning Tips | Adjusting k, M, α, iters for latency vs quality | BENCHMARKS.md |
| FAQ | Concise answers (Why ΔH? vs rerankers?) | README appendix |

## Outdated / Redundant Docs
| File | Issue | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| BUILD_PLAN.md | Historical planning; superseded by ROADMAP.md | Archive or fold salient deltas into ROADMAP.md |
| NEXT_IMPROVEMENTS.md | Overlaps ROADMAP + pivot doc | Merge relevant items then delete |
| ConsciousDB_Simulations_Phases_A-G.md | Replaced by SIMULATIONS.md | Remove legacy file after content migration |
| PRICING_MODEL.md | Removed per decision | Confirm absence |

## Proposed New Files
- CONFIGURATION.md
- OPERATIONS.md
- ADAPTIVE.md
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- BENCHMARKS.md

## Sequencing Recommendation
1. CONFIGURATION.md (foundation for others)
2. OPERATIONS.md (metrics + logging unify)
3. ADAPTIVE.md (references config & ops)
4. TROUBLESHOOTING.md (builds on previous)
5. BENCHMARKS.md (after ops metrics stable)

## Notes
Keep new docs modular: each with Purpose, Scope, Quick Start (where relevant), and Reference sections. Avoid duplication by deep-linking to source-of-truth tables (e.g., configuration variables appear only in CONFIGURATION.md and are linked elsewhere).
