# Normalized Coherence & Energy Gap Migration Worklog (Completed)

Status: COMPLETED. The normalization rollout (Phases 0–3) is finished; the system now operates solely with normalized per‑node coherence attribution, receipts are fixed at version 2, and all legacy flags / dual paths have been removed. This file is retained temporarily as an historical worklog and may be deleted in a future cleanup.

## Executive Summary
We migrated from an ad‑hoc (effectively unnormalized) per‑edge coherence attribution to a mathematically principled formulation using the symmetric normalized Laplacian \(L_{sym} = I - D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2}\). We added an auditable quadratic energy gap identity (ΔH trace form), surfaced conditioning guidance (`kappa_bound`), instrumented operational metrics, staged the rollout under feature flags, validated parity, then removed all legacy code and schema artifacts. The diagnostic field `deltaH_rel_diff` (used during rollout) has been renamed to `deltaH_scope_diff` to reflect that it measures scope truncation divergence (top‑k vs full candidate set), not an internal identity error.

## Timeline & Phases
| Phase | Focus | Key Artifacts / Actions | Outcome |
|-------|-------|-------------------------|---------|
| 0 | Dual-path prototype & plan | `USE_NORMALIZED_COH` flag, trace identity (`deltaH_trace`), provisional `deltaH_rel_diff` | Parallel normalized computation validated on test loads |
| 1 | Observation & metrics | Adoption counters, warning logs on large rel diff, load experiment | Established baseline distributions (p95 scope diff ~0.375) |
| 2 | Default flip & version bump | Default flag ON, receipts v2, escape hatch `FORCE_LEGACY_COH` | Normalized path became authoritative; downstream consumers aligned |
| 3 | Cleanup & consolidation | Removed flags/legacy branch, renamed metric to `deltaH_scope_diff`, removed adoption counter & plan doc references | Codebase simplified; docs normalized‑only |

## Delivered Changes (Technical)
1. Normalized Laplacian-based per-node coherence attribution producing non-negative, degree-consistent deltas.
2. Energy gap quadratic identity: `deltaH_total` (summed components) cross-checked with `deltaH_trace` (trace form) for auditability.
3. Conditioning diagnostic: `kappa_bound` heuristic upper bound for the composite matrix \(M = \lambda_G I + \lambda_C L_{sym} + \lambda_Q B\).
4. Scope divergence metric: `deltaH_scope_diff` (formerly rollout-only `deltaH_rel_diff`) quantifying omitted long-tail contribution from truncated candidate lists.
5. Telemetry: Prometheus histograms for ΔH distributions, solver latencies/iterations, redundancy, plus counters for fallback/gate events (adoption counters pruned after stabilization).
6. Schema simplification: Removed `coherence_mode` and all legacy per-node delta fields; receipts standardized to v2.
7. Documentation overhaul: `ALGORITHM.md`, `API.md`, `RECEIPTS.md` rewritten for normalized-only semantics; migration narrative extracted here and no longer pollutes primary docs.
8. Test suite refactor: Eliminated dual-path assertions; conservation & diagnostics tests target normalized path exclusively.

## Removed / Deprecated Artifacts
| Artifact | Status | Replacement / Rationale |
|----------|--------|-------------------------|
| `USE_NORMALIZED_COH`, `FORCE_LEGACY_COH` | Removed | Single canonical path—rollback risk now negligible |
| Legacy per-node coherence branch | Removed | Normalized attribution stable & validated |
| `coherence_mode` response field | Removed | Static value post-flip; eliminated noise |
| `deltaH_rel_diff` | Renamed | Now `deltaH_scope_diff` to clarify semantics |
| Adoption counter `conscious_coherence_mode_total` | Removed | Served its rollout purpose |
| Migration planning doc sections in primary docs | Removed | Historical context confined to this worklog |

## Metric Semantics (Current)
| Field | Meaning | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `deltaH_total` | Sum of per-node (coherence + ground + anchor) contributions | Non-negative; primary energy gap scalar |
| `deltaH_trace` | Quadratic trace-form ΔH | Cross-check; should match within FP tolerance |
| `deltaH_scope_diff` | (|ΔH_full - ΔH_returned|) / (ΔH_full + ε) | Measures truncation divergence; larger when tail nodes omitted |
| `kappa_bound` | Heuristic condition number upper bound | Operational alerting candidate (not yet exported) |
| `coherence_fraction` | ΔH coherence term / ΔH_total | Audit share; may approach 1.0 on synthetic data |

## Validation Highlights
* Parity: No material regression in fallback rate or latency after flip; solver iteration counts unchanged.
* Stability: p95 `deltaH_scope_diff` remained within expected band (~0.35–0.40) across synthetic stress tests.
* Determinism: Trace vs summed component ΔH discrepancy below 1e-8 tolerance in tests.

## Lessons Learned
1. Early explicit audit identity (`deltaH_trace`) materially reduced risk during deprecation.
2. Naming clarity matters—renaming to `deltaH_scope_diff` reduced analyst confusion versus “relative diff”.
3. Staging with counters accelerated confidence; removing them quickly post-cutover avoided metric clutter.
4. Consolidating final math & schema into authoritative docs prevented divergent narratives.

## Follow-up Opportunities (Non-blocking)
* Extend diagnostics with ground / anchor fractions if external audits demand deeper term attribution.
* Optional export of `kappa_bound` histogram for proactive conditioning alerts.
* Graph visualization overlay (degree-normalized vs raw) for educational/demo purposes.
* Backfill historical normalization uplift report for investor deck.

## Historical Raw Plan (Collapsed)
The original phased plan (flags, adoption counters, receipt version bump, cleanup) has been fully executed. See prior git history for the removed step-by-step instructions if archaeological detail is required.

## Deletion Notice
This worklog is no longer operationally required. It can be safely deleted once remaining stakeholders acknowledge completion (e.g., after benchmark enhancements land) to reduce repository surface area.
