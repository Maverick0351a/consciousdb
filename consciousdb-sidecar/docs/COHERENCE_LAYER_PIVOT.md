ConsciousDB — From Sidecar to Coherence Layer for AI Retrieval

Tagline: ConsciousDB is the coherence layer for AI retrieval — it makes your existing vector database auditable, explainable, and adaptive, without moving data.

1) What the pivot means (in one page)
Old framing: stateless sidecar in front of a vector DB

Purpose: re‑rank ANN hits and return a better top‑K.

Value: modest quality gains, low integration friction.

Limitation: reads like “another re‑ranker.” Harder to justify enterprise ACV or win compliance/security stakeholders.

New framing: Coherence Layer

A thin, non‑invasive layer that sits beside your vector DB and adds three enterprise‑critical capabilities:

Auditable — Every result ships with an explainability receipt: a coherence score (ΔH) with per‑node decomposition that shows why items were promoted (structure‑aware), where the neighborhood came from (local subgraph), and how much the query changed the state.

Explainable — The ranking is governed by a mathematically grounded energy/coherence model (Laplacian smoothness + query anchoring). We don’t hand‑wave relevance; we measure it.

Adaptive — (Optional) A managed graph state learns edge strengths and hyper‑parameters (bandit style) from feedback, without ever copying your data out of your system.

Without moving data: You keep embeddings & metadata in your existing vector DB (Pinecone, pgvector, Vertex AI, Chroma). ConsciousDB connects over private links/VPC and only pulls ephemeral candidate vectors per query.

Why this matters:

Trust: Compliance and QA teams can audit “why this answer.”

Control: Tunable gates & SLOs prevent regressions.

ROI: Improved uplift (+3–5% nDCG@K in sims) at low latency, plus a dashboard that proves it.

2) What “coherence” actually is (non‑hand‑wavy)

We treat retrieval as making the induced neighborhood around a query more coherent.

Define a quadratic energy over the subgraph:

Grounding keeps adaptive embeddings close to originals (prevents drift).

Coherence (graph Laplacian) prefers neighbors to agree (smoothness).

Anchoring pulls relevant nodes toward the query.

We solve a strictly SPD linear system (CG‑friendly) on a small induced subgraph, then rank using:

coherence_drop (how much the query improved local smoothness) +

smoothed alignment (cos(q*, y)) after the solve.

This gives a scalar, audit‑ready ΔH / coherence score. It’s not a heuristic; it’s a measure of how much the neighborhood “settled” for this query.

What changed from sidecar:

It’s not “just” re‑ranking. It’s structure‑aware optimization with an interpretable score that travels with the result.

3) Architecture (what runs where)

Data plane stays put. ConsciousDB pulls only: top‑M IDs + vectors → builds a tiny subgraph in memory → solves → returns results + receipts. No corpus migration.

Key components

Connectors (BYOVDB): Pinecone, pgvector, Vertex AI, Chroma (premium connectors add per‑backend tuning, SLAs, VPC/private link, credential management).

Retriever: ANN recall → kNN adjacency over recalled vectors (k=5, cos+, mutual).

Coherence solve: SPD system on |S|×|S| (M≈200–400 typical). Jacobi preconditioner on by default.

Gates: Easy‑query (skip solve if cosine is obviously separable) and Low‑impact (skip if total coherence gain is tiny).

Expansion: optional 1‑hop context for hard queries (gap < 0.08, cap 1.5×M), rank only S.

Explainability payload: per‑item coherence/anchor/ground terms + neighbor IDs + timings + CG iterations.

(Optional) Managed graph state: Redis/Memorystore to persist sparse edges & feedback for learning (strictly hashed IDs, no content).

SLOs & guardrails

P95 solve under 250–400 ms @ K≤8.

Fallbacks and gates guarantee “do no harm.”

Metrics: queries_total, used_deltaH_rate, used_expand_rate, cg_iters, stage latencies, redundancy.

4) Why this is different (and valuable)

Against raw vector DBs: They’re great at ANN, but do not explain why results rank, nor adapt structure to query intent. We add coherence reasoning + receipts.
Against rerankers / MMR: MMR diversifies, but can hurt relevance and isn’t auditable. We optimize a convex coherence objective and expose ΔH.
Against GraphRAG: You get graph benefits without building a global graph. We induce local graphs on‑the‑fly from the customer’s vectors—zero ingestion burden, zero governance headache.

Proof points from simulations (A–G)

Uplift: +3–5% nDCG@10 on ambiguous queries; no regressions on easy ones due to gates.

Speed: Jacobi preconditioner reduces median solve time ~25% vs none.

Adjacency: k=5, cos+, mutual > k=10/20; less leakage, better iterations.

Expansion: small, positive lift on hard queries; cap at 1.5×M.

MMR: reduce redundancy but hurts nDCG at K=10; reserve MMR for K>8 + high redundancy.

5) What “auditable, explainable, adaptive” looks like in practice

Auditable

Explainability receipt per query: ΔH total, per‑item coherence_drop, local neighbors with edge weights, CG iters, residuals, and gate reasons.

Traceable: you can show which edges and which anchor strengths moved a node up.

Explainable

Ranking is a weighted sum of z‑scored coherence_drop and smoothed alignment; alpha is tunable and logged.

Gates are explicit, measurable rules; no “secret sauce.”

Adaptive

Optional Hebbian‑with‑decay updates a tenant‑scoped sparse adjacency (with degree caps and drift monitors).

Bandit hyper‑tuning chooses α, β, τ (and even k_adj) per tenant/workload based on feedback success signals.

Crucially: no raw data leaves the tenant’s DB; only lightweight state (edges on hashed IDs) is stored, and it’s opt‑in.

6) Packaging & monetization (why the pivot raises the ceiling)

Open‑core SDK (free): local dev, no state, BYOVDB connectors.

Managed service (SaaS): hosted coherence layer with multi‑tenant isolation, explainability receipts, gating dashboards, and SLOs.

Premium connectors (Enterprise): tuned backends, private links/VPC, managed credentials, compliance reporting.

On‑prem / VPC deployment: the layer runs inside customer network if required.

ACV targets

Pro (BYOVDB SaaS): $5–12k/yr

Enterprise (premium connectors + VPC): $50–250k/yr

Regulated verticals: $250–1M/yr with custom compliance and SLAs

7) Buyer‑aligned outcomes (talk tracks)

LLM/RAG Engineer: “Drop this in and your top‑K gets smarter. You’ll see uplift and a receipt that proves why—so you can tune, not guess.”
Head of Data/Platform: “You keep your DB. We add a provable, governed retrieval layer—no data migration.”
Compliance/SecOps: “Every answer has an auditable trail and runs over private connectivity. No corpus leaves your control.”
CTO/CIO: “Lower LLM spend (fewer follow‑up calls), higher acceptance rate, no re‑platforming, fast wins for stakeholders.”

8) Operational changes from the pivot (what we implement next)

Defaults & gates (from sims)

k_adj=5, weights=cos+, mutual=True

α=0.1; MMR OFF (enable only for K>8 & high redundancy)

Expansion when gap<0.08, cap=1.5×M; rank only S

Jacobi preconditioner ON by default

Diagnostics & SLOs to expose now

edge_count, avg_degree, weights_mode

used_deltaH, used_expand_1hop, similarity_gap, coh_drop_total

cg_iters_min/med/max, residual; stage timings (embed, ann, build, solve, rank)

Redundancy metric on top‑K (mean pairwise cosine)

Security posture (to close enterprise)

API key auth; per‑tenant rate limit

Private networking (VPC/Private Link) to vector DBs; managed credentials

Audit log stream (no secrets, PII‑safe), configurable retention

Commercial readiness

“Explainability receipts” dashboard (ΔH, gates, SLOs)

Pricing switches tied to QPS, M caps, and premium connectors

Design‑partner runbook (2‑week pilot): install, connect, evaluate uplift, produce receipts

9) KPIs & proof you can show in 2–4 weeks

Quality: +3–5% nDCG@K on the tenant’s corpus (measured in your bench harness)

Efficiency: P95 latency in budget, fallback < 5%

Explainability: receipts attached in 100% of requests; gate/fallback counters in metrics

Adoption: time‑to‑first‑answer < 1 hour (BYOVDB)

Security: VPC/private link in place for at least one connector; credential scans clean

10) What could still go wrong (and how we hedge)

Approximate adjacency too lossy: enforce edge‑overlap ≥ 0.25–0.30 vs exact in CI; fall back to exact on poor overlap.

Latency spikes on big M: hard caps + gates + factorization cache for hot neighborhoods; fallback to vector‑only path.

Tenant drift / overfitting: degree caps, decay, renormalization; drift monitor on ∥Q−X∥.

Connector flakiness: retries with jitter and max elapsed; health probes; clear error payloads.

11) The investor line (use this verbatim)

“ConsciousDB is the coherence layer for AI retrieval. It plugs into Pinecone/pgvector/Vertex/Chroma and makes search auditable and adaptive with a physics‑grounded coherence score (ΔH). There’s no data migration, and every answer ships with an explainability receipt. That’s how we sell trust—and that’s why enterprise buyers will pay.”

12) Immediate to‑dos (so Copilot ships the right thing)

Update defaults & gates in the service to match the simulation wins.

Add diagnostics & Prometheus metrics listed above.

Finish pgvector & Pinecone connectors (with startup dim checks).

Land docs/BENCHMARKS.md (already prepared) and this pivot doc.

Add a “Receipts” tab in the demo UI (or JSON responses in Postman collection) showing ΔH, neighbors, CG iters, and gate reasons.

Make no mistake: the coherence layer pitch moves this from “tooling” to infrastructure. You’re selling trust, control, and explainability to organizations that already invested in vector databases—and you’re doing it without asking them to move their data. That’s the wedge.
