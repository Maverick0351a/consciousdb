## Contributing to ConsciousDB

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project treats your existing vector database as the model via a convex coherence optimization. High signal, wellâ€‘scoped contributions keep iteration velocity high while preserving mathematical and operational integrity.

### Development Setup
1. Clone & create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # PowerShell: . .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .[dev]
```
2. (Optional) Install extras for connectors / embedders:
```bash
pip install -e .[embedders-sentencetransformers,connectors-pinecone,connectors-chroma]
```
3. Run the API (mock connector):
```bash
export USE_MOCK=true
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

### Running Tests & Coverage
We enforce 85% line coverage (CI fails below threshold).
```bash
pytest -q --cov=. --cov-report=term --cov-report=xml
```
Upload to Codecov locally (optional) with:
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash) -f coverage.xml || true
```

### Linting & Type Checks
```bash
ruff check .
mypy .
```
Run these before pushing; the CI pipeline runs ruff + mypy + tests + coverage.

### Pull Request Guidelines
1. Create a descriptive branch name: `feature/<short-desc>` or `fix/<issue-id>`.
2. Keep PRs small & focused (prefer <500 LOC diff excluding generated / tests).
3. Include / update tests for new logic (happy path + at least one edge case).
4. Update relevant docs (`docs/ALGORITHM.md`, `RECEIPTS.md`, `API.md`) if schema or math changes.
5. Avoid premature abstractionsâ€”optimize for clarity over cleverness.
6. Do not introduce new heavy dependencies without discussion (open an issue first).
7. Add structured logs instead of ad-hoc prints; keep receipt schema additions backwards-compatible.

### Commit Message Style
Use conventional-ish prefixes:
`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `perf:`, `build:`, `chore:`.

Example:
```
feat: add MS MARCO dataset loader with caching layer
```

### Architectural Notes
Core loop: embed -> recall -> local graph -> SPD solve (CG) -> per-node Î”H attribution -> rank -> receipt.
Per-node energy terms must sum (within FP tolerance) to `deltaH_total` and align with `deltaH_trace`.
Any solver changes must maintain symmetry & positive definiteness of the system matrix.

### Filing Issues
Provide: purpose, minimal reproduction (if bug), expected vs actual behavior, environment (OS, Python, connector). Label clearly (`bug`, `enhancement`, `docs`).

### Security
Report vulnerabilities privately first (open a security advisory or email the maintainer). Avoid creating PoC exploit PRs without coordination.

### License & CLA
Code is under BSL 1.1 with future conversion to Apache 2.0. Submitting a PR implies you have the right to contribute under that license; no separate CLA currently required.

### Thank You
Your contributions help push an explainable, physics-inspired alternative to opaque rerankers. ðŸš€
## Contributing to ConsciousDB Sidecar

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project treats the vector database itself as the model ("database-as-model"). Contributions should preserve transparency, auditability, and low operational overhead.

### Quick Start
```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/Scripts/activate  # PowerShell: . .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e .[dev]
pytest -q
```

### Development Workflow
1. Fork & branch: `feat/<short-topic>` or `fix/<issue-id>`.
2. Add/adjust tests (prefer test-first for bug fixes & public behavior changes).
3. Run lint & type checks locally (will be enforced in CI):
   ```bash
   ruff check .
   mypy consciousdb-sidecar
   pytest --cov=consciousdb-sidecar
   ```
4. (First time) install git hooks: `pre-commit install` (auto lint/format/safety on commit)
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `Unreleased` with a concise entry (Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed).
5. Submit PR with template sections completed.

### Style & Standards
- **Python Version**: 3.11+
- **Lint**: Ruff (configured in `pyproject.toml`). Keep PRs lint-clean.
- **Formatting**: Ruffâ€™s implied style; avoid massive unrelated reformatting.
- **Types**: Gradually increase coverage. New/modified functions should include type hints.
- **Logging**: Use structured logging (dict-like extra fields); avoid print.
- **Tests**: Use `pytest`. Keep them fast (unit/integration < ~5s). Avoid external network calls.

### Commit Guidelines
- Use conventional-ish prefixes for readability: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `build:`, `ci:`.
- Keep first line â‰¤ 72 chars; add detail below if needed.

### Branch Protection Expectations
PR must:
- Pass CI (lint, types, tests, coverage threshold).
- Contain test updates for changed logic.
- Update CHANGELOG if user-facing.
- Avoid lowering coverage materially without justification.

### Security / Sensitive Data
- Do not log API keys or raw customer content.
- Adaptive state must remain metadata-only (no raw document text).

### Performance Considerations
- Provide micro-benchmark or rationale when changing solver, ranking, or graph construction.
- Keep default dependency footprint minimal (optional extras for connectors/embedders).

### Release Process (Planned)
- Tag `vX.Y.Z` â†’ CI builds sdist/wheel & container â†’ GitHub Release notes auto-generated from CHANGELOG.

### Questions / Discussion
Open a GitHub Discussion or issue; for architectural shifts propose an RFC (markdown doc) summarizing motivation & alternatives.

Thanks for helping build a model-free, transparent retrieval coherence layer!
